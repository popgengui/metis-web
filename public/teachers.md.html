# Introduction

Most models should be straightforward and are not discussed here


# Structured models

Migration in structured models is given as an absolute value. For example:

On an island model with 3 demes and 2 migrants, that means that each
deme will export 4 individuals, 2 for each of the remaining demes

!!! WARNING
    The current version does not check if there are enough individuals
    to migrate, so if you have a deme size of 10, 5 demes and 3 migrants,
    the code will break. This will be sorted soon.

## Island models

Island models do not wrap around. One and two Dimensions are supported.

Of course, demes at borders will send and receive less individuals than
more cosmopolitan demes at the center.

# Recombination

Note that the relationship between probability of recombination and
genetic distance (d in cM) is:


$$ P[recomb] = \frac{1 - e^{\frac{-2d}{100}}}{2} $$

It is **not**:

$$ P[recomb] = \frac{d}{100} $$
