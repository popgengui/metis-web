# Preliminary notes

Most models should be straightforward and are not discussed here. Please
contact us if you disagree.

# Tweaks for teaching

We have made some changes to the behavior of the simulations in order
to insure a smoother experience. These changes are documented here

## Sex generation

Sex generators used in the teaching tool will always generate at least
one element of each sex. This is particularly important for small
populations (say with a N of 10) where there would be a reasonable
probability that only one sex would be generated, thus stopping
the simulation due to no mating possibilities.

This should have no qualitative impact bu we suggest that, if you are
interested in small populations - say in conservation settings - 
that you discuss this with your students.

# Models

## Introductory models

- Wright-Fisher. Standard, no sex. SNPs and Microsats
- Wright-Fisher with sex
- Changing initial frequency of derived allele
- Stochasticity of models

!!!
    Unless otherwise noticed all models include male and female sex


## Population fluctuation

- Decline or expansion

## Selection

- Dominant
- Recessive
- Heterozygote advantage

## Structured populations

Migration in structured models is given as an absolute value. For example:

On an island model with 3 demes and 2 migrants, that means that each
deme will export 4 individuals, 2 for each of the remaining demes

!!! WARNING
    The current version does not check if there are enough individuals
    to migrate, so if you have a deme size of 10, 5 demes and 3 migrants,
    the code will break. This will be sorted soon.

### Island models

Island models do not wrap around. One and two Dimensions are supported.

Of course, demes at borders will send and receive less individuals than
more cosmopolitan demes at the center.

## Mating

### Sex-ratio

Specifies the sex-ratio of the population

### Alpha-male

Model where a single male sire x% of the population

## Recombination

Note that the relationship between probability of recombination and
genetic distance (d in cM) is:


$$ P[recomb] = \frac{1 - e^{\frac{-2d}{100}}}{2} $$

It is **not**:

$$ P[recomb] = \frac{d}{100} $$
